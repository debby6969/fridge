# 🧊 **The Green Fridge Project**  
A tiny web app with a big personality.

## 🌱 What is this?
The Green Fridge Project started as a simple idea:  
**make a playful, lightweight web app that does a few things well — and looks cool doing it.**

It’s a small project built for fun, learning, and experimenting with Python, Flask, HTML templates, and basic APIs.

## 🚀 Features
- **Weather page** — pulls live weather data and displays it in a clean template  
- **Simple routing** — Flask-powered pages with easy-to-read structure  
- **Custom templates** — HTML pages styled with your own flavour  
- **Beginner-friendly codebase** — perfect for experimenting and expanding

## 🧩 Tech Stack
- **Python 3**
- **Flask**
- **HTML / CSS templates**
- **Replit / GitHub** for hosting and version control

## 📁 Project Structure

## 🎯 Goals
- Keep learning Flask  
- Add more pages and features  
- Turn a fun idea into a clean, working mini‑app  
- Maybe even deploy it properly one day

## 🤝 Contributing
This is a personal learning project — but feel free to fork it, remix it, or build your own version.

## 🧊 Why “Green Fridge”?
Because every project needs a name.  
And this one felt cool.
